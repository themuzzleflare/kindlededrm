# Kindle DeDRM
One of the first proper implementations of Amazon's Kindle DRM scheme in Java. Closely resembles apprenticeharper's DeDRM tools for Python.

Currently Supported:
- .azw3 eBook files downloaded from Amazon.com (You must own a physical Kindle eReader. The decryption key will be derived from the serial number)
- .kfx-zip files downloaded through Kindle for Mac/PC (Works on versions 1.33 and below)
- .kfx files downloaded on your physical Kindle and transferred to your computer. (again, serial number needed)

Coming Soon:
- ~~JavaFX GUI~~
- Support for Topaz eBooks
- Support for Android/iOS Kindle Keys
- ~~Key files needed for Kindle Mac/PC decryption~~
